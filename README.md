# Jobs Nearby
An aggregator platform for workers and owners where workers can get jobs nearby based on skills and owners can create job posts and look for skilled workers nearby.
This platform brings Owners an easy access to find out workers/labours near their locality for factory/shop/house and enable labours to get regular job/work requirements from nearby/selected location and can apply for them.

# Motivation
  1. Due to Covid-19 situation, all the labourers have moved to their native towns and villages which have created a big demand for workers in big cities at factories/shops. Owners are not able to find workers for their work.
  2. Hiring labour/workers is a very unorganised market and mouth publicity play the role of getting workers at factories/shops/house. Due to which many workers are not able to find the potential job as per their skills.
  3. There is a huge gap between owners and labours due to which lot many owners are not able to find potential workers for their business. This is same for labours and due to which many people are unemployed (berozgaar) and not able to earn more money.
  4. This application will make this market organised and bring both parties on one platform which will increase employment for workers near their native towns.
  5. Getting work near their town can help labours to save more money. And owners can easily find right potential labours based on skills and experience.
